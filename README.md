This is made as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It is my take on the Todo list. 

This webapp can be used to make your personal medication list with 
1) List of medications - with name, strength, frequency, and notes.
2) Set time to take medication by. 
3) Ways of grouping medications by disease state or time of day to take (ex. all morning meds).
