The Medication List project is made as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It is a variation of the Todo list. This project uses webpack to bundle modules.


This webapp can be used to make your personal medication list with 
1) Medications as objects created by classes. 
2) Medications will have properties of name, strength, frequency, condition and notes.
3) Medications will have a daily checklist to see if they were taken for the day. 
4) Medications can be grouped into lists. The first list will be "Your Med List". Can add new lists for conditions or other people/animals.
